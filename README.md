# SimpleFS - a simple File System
Final project of Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science course (API) - A.Y. 2016/2017 Politecnico di Milano.

## Description
The aim of the project is to implement a simple hierarchical file system based on UNIX FS syntax stored uniquely in volatile memory. The program must be implemented in `C99`, using only the standard library (`libc`) and the base runtime.
The program that implements the file system will receive a journal of
the actions from stdin and will print the result on stdout.

The project assignment can be found [here].
